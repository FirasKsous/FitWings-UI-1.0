## UI/UX Design Prompts for Fitness Coaching App (Part 1: App Structure and Workout Tab - Detailed - Markdown)

**Overall Goal:** Design a modern, clean, and intuitive mobile fitness coaching application specifically designed for busy professionals. The app should seamlessly integrate personalized training plans generated by an AI coach with the flexibility for users to create their own custom workouts. The preferred visual style is a dark theme with vibrant neon blue accents, but the app should also offer a user-switchable light theme to cater to individual preferences. The Gyrochrome font should be used for headings and key text elements where appropriate, ensuring excellent readability and a modern aesthetic. Prioritize a user-friendly and efficient experience with smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance engagement.

**I. Core App Structure and Navigation:**

1.  **Fundamental App Structure and Theme Management:** The app should be structured around three primary sections, accessible through a fixed tab navigation bar located at the top of the screen. These sections are: "Profile Dashboard," "Nutrition," and "Workout."

    *   **Theme Switching:** Implement a clear and easily accessible setting that allows users to switch between the dark theme and a light theme. This setting could be placed within the "Profile Dashboard" or a dedicated "Settings" section.
    *   **Dark Theme Styling:** The dark theme should utilize dark grays and blacks for background elements, providing a high-contrast backdrop for white or light gray text. Neon blue should be used strategically as an accent color for interactive elements (buttons, icons, selected tabs, progress indicators) to create visual interest and highlight key actions.
    *   **Light Theme Styling:** The light theme should use white or light gray backgrounds with dark gray or black text for optimal readability. Neon blue should still be used as an accent color, but in a way that complements the lighter background.

2.  **Top Tab Navigation Bar:** A fixed tab navigation bar should be positioned at the top of the screen, providing constant access to the main sections.

    *   **Tab Elements:** Each tab should display a concise text label clearly indicating its function (e.g., "Profile," "Nutrition," "Workout"). Optionally, a small, relevant icon can be included next to the text label to further enhance visual recognition.
    *   **Active Tab Indication:** The currently active tab should be visually distinguished from the inactive tabs. This can be achieved through a neon blue underline beneath the active tab's text, a change in the tab's background color to a slightly lighter gray (in dark mode) or a slightly darker gray (in light mode) with neon blue text, or a combination of both.
    *   **Smooth Tab Transitions:** When a user taps on a tab, the transition to the corresponding section should be smooth and animated, providing a seamless user experience. Consider a subtle sliding or fading animation.

3.  **Persistent Chat Input Area (Workout Tab):** On the main "Workout" tab screen, a chat input area should be persistently displayed at the bottom of the screen. This area provides a direct communication channel between the user and the AI personal trainer.

    *   **Chat Input Field:** The chat input area should include a multiline text input field, allowing users to type longer messages if needed. The input field should have a clear placeholder text (e.g., "Type your message...") to guide the user.
    *   **"Send" Button:** A clearly visible "Send" button should be positioned next to the text input field, enabling users to send their messages. A send icon (e.g., a paper airplane or an arrow) can be used on the button for better visual clarity.
    *   **Visual Separation:** The chat input area should be visually separated from the main content area of the "Workout" tab using a subtle background color difference (e.g., a slightly darker gray in dark mode) or a subtle shadow effect. This helps to distinguish the chat functionality from the workout information.

**II. "Workout" Tab Layout and Workout Cards (Main View - "My Plan"):**

1.  **Default View - "My Plan":** When the user selects the "Workout" tab, the default view they see should be "My Plan." This view specifically displays the workouts assigned to the user as part of their personalized training plan, scheduled for the current day or week.

2.  **Workout Cards (Visual Presentation):** Each assigned workout within the "My Plan" view should be presented as a distinct, visually engaging card. This card format should provide a quick overview of the workout's key information.

    *   **Workout Name (Prominent Display):** The workout's name should be displayed prominently at the top of the card using a larger, bold font (ideally Gyrochrome if appropriate for the specific design).
    *   **Representative Image/Icon (Visual Cue):** A relevant image or icon should be displayed on each card to provide a visual cue for the workout type. For example, a barbell image for strength training, a running figure for cardio, or a yoga pose for flexibility training. If actual images are not yet available, use high-quality placeholder images that are visually appealing and relevant to the workout type.
    *   **Concise Description (Expandable Functionality):** A brief, concise description of the workout should be provided (e.g., "Full Body Strength Training focusing on compound movements," "High-Intensity Interval Training for fat loss"). This description should be initially truncated to save space on the card. An expandable/collapsible functionality should be implemented, triggered by tapping a small downward-pointing arrow or "+" icon located at the bottom of the description area. When the user taps this icon, the full description should be revealed with a smooth animation (e.g., a smooth vertical expansion).
    *   **Estimated Workout Duration (Time Commitment):** The estimated duration of the workout should be clearly displayed (e.g., "45 mins," "1 hour"). Use a clear and concise format to communicate the time commitment required for the workout.
    *   **Workout Intensity (Visual Representation):** For workouts where intensity is a relevant factor (e.g., HIIT, cardio), a visual indicator of the workout's intensity level should be displayed. This could be a progress bar-like indicator that fills up based on the intensity level, a series of icons (e.g., flames or energy bolts), or a numerical rating (e.g., 1-5).
    *   **Targeted Muscle Groups (Highlighted Body Image):** The main muscle groups targeted by the workout should be visually represented using a stylized human body image. The specific muscle groups targeted by the workout should be highlighted on the body image using neon blue. This provides a quick and effective way for users to understand which muscles will be engaged during the workout.
    *   **Workout Type Icon (Visual Classification):** A small icon representing the general type of workout (e.g., strength, cardio, HIIT, flexibility) should be displayed on the card. This provides another quick visual cue for users to classify the workout.

3.  **"Explore Workouts" Section (Access to Workout Library):** A clearly labeled button or tab should be included on the "Workout" tab to provide access to the "Explore Workouts" section or "Workout Library." This section will house all the available workouts and provide filtering and sorting options.

4.  **"Create Workout" Button (Custom Workout Creation):** A "Create Workout" button should be prominently placed within the "Workout" tab, allowing users to create their own custom workouts. The button should use a descriptive icon (e.g., a plus sign within a rounded square or a "Create" icon) to clearly communicate its function. Consider placing the button in the top right corner of the screen or at the bottom, depending on the overall layout and design.

## UI/UX Design Prompts for Fitness Coaching App (Part 2: Workout Details Modal and Exercise Table - Detailed - Markdown)

**Continuing from Part 1:** This section provides detailed instructions for the design and functionality of the modal bottom sheet that appears when a user taps on a workout card in the "My Plan" view, along with the structure and elements of the exercise tables displayed within the modal.

**III. Workout Details Modal (Draggable Bottom Sheet):**

1.  **Modal Presentation and Behavior:** When a user taps on a workout card in the "My Plan" view, a modal bottom sheet should smoothly animate upwards from the bottom of the screen. This modal should exhibit the following behavior:

    *   **Background Scrim (Overlay):** While the modal is open, a semi-transparent dark scrim (overlay) should be displayed over the background content. This scrim should use the color RGB(0, 30, 170) with an appropriate alpha (opacity) value to create a subtle dimming effect, clearly indicating that the background content is currently inactive and cannot be interacted with.
    *   **Vertical Draggability:** The modal should be vertically draggable by the user. This allows them to partially reveal or conceal the workout details as needed.
    *   **Minimization to Bottom Button:** When the user drags the modal fully downwards, it should smoothly minimize into a button positioned at the bottom center of the screen. This minimized button should display the workout's name and the continuously running elapsed workout timer.
    *   **Background Interaction (Minimized State):** When the modal is minimized to the bottom button, the user should be able to interact with the background content of the "Workout" tab, allowing them to browse other workouts or access other features.
    *   **Workout Termination Confirmation:** If the user attempts to start a new workout (by tapping on another workout card) while aworkout is already active (either fully open or minimized), a clear confirmation dialog should appear. This dialog should ask the user if they want to terminate the currently active workout before proceeding with the new one, preventing accidental data loss.

2.  **Modal Content and Structure:** The content displayed within the modal bottom sheet should be structured as follows:

    *   **Workout Header (Prominent Title):** The workout's name should be displayed prominently at the very top of the modal, using a large, bold font (ideally Gyrochrome if appropriate for the visual style). This serves as the clear title for the workout details.
    *   **Workout Progress Indicator (Animated Circular Progress):** An animated circular progress bar should be positioned near the workout name (e.g., to the left or right). This progress bar should visually represent the overall progress of the workout, displaying the percentage of exercises that have been marked as complete. The animation should smoothly update as the user completes exercises within the workout.
    *   **"Start Workout"/"Pause Workout" Button and Elapsed Timer:** A button labeled "Start Workout" should be placed next to the workout name.

        *   **"Start Workout" Functionality:** When the user taps the "Start Workout" button:
            *   The button's label should change to "Pause Workout" (or the button's icon should change to a pause icon).
            *   An elapsed timer should start counting upwards from 0:00. This timer should be displayed clearly next to the button.
            *   The timer should continue running even if the modal is minimized to the bottom button, providing a persistent record of the workout's duration.
        *   **"Pause Workout" Functionality:** When the user taps the "Pause Workout" button:
            *   The button's label should change back to "Start Workout" (or the icon should change back to a play icon).
            *   The elapsed timer should pause.
    *   **Warm-up Section (Conditional Display):** If the workout includes a warm-up routine, a separate section with a clear heading (e.g., "Warm-up") should be displayed below the workout header. This section should list the warm-up exercises with their corresponding durations or repetitions. If the workout does not include a warm-up, this section should be omitted.
    *   **Exercise Tables/Cards (Detailed Exercise Information):** Below the warm-up section (or directly below the workout header if there's no warm-up), each exercise within the workout should be displayed in its own distinct table or card.

**IV. Detailed Exercise Table/Card Structure (Within the Modal):**

1.  **Individual Exercise Presentation:** Each exercise within the workout should be presented in a separate, visually distinct table or card, providing all the necessary information for the user to perform the exercise.

    *   **Exercise Name (Tappable for Video/Description):** The exercise's name should be displayed as a clear heading at the top of the table/card, using a bold font. Tapping on the exercise name should open a separate modal or overlay (detailed in Part 3) that displays a video demonstration of the exercise (if available) and a detailed written description of the exercise.
    *   **Quick Exercise Instructions/Tips (Tooltip Functionality):** A small "info" icon (e.g., an "i" enclosed in a circle) should be placed next to the exercise name. Tapping on this icon should trigger the display of a small tooltip or brief description containing key instructions or tips for performing the exercise correctly. This tooltip should appear smoothly and disappear when the user taps elsewhere on the screen or after a short delay.
    *   **Set Rows (Tracking Sets, Reps, Weight, and RPE):** Below the exercise name and tooltip icon, the sets for the exercise should be displayed in individual rows. Each set row should contain the following columns:

        *   **Set Number (Clear Identification):** The set number should be clearly displayed at the beginning of each row (e.g., "Set 1," "Set 2," "Set 3").
        *   **Weight Input Field (Numerical Input):** A number input field should be provided for the user to enter the weight they lifted for that particular set.
        *   **Reps Input Field (Numerical Input):** A number input field should be provided for the user to enter the number of repetitions they performed for that set.
        *   **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) Display Box (Tappable for RPE Selection):** A dedicated display box should be provided for the RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) value. This box should initially be empty or display a placeholder (e.g., "RPE"). Tapping on this box should open the RPE selection pop-up (detailed in Part 3), allowing the user to select their RPE for that set.
        *   **"Done" Checkbox (Set Completion Indication):** A checkbox should be positioned at the end of each set row. When the user checks this checkbox, the entire row should be visually marked as complete by covering it with a semi-transparent dark blue overlay (using the color RGB(0, 30, 170) with an appropriate alpha/opacity). A subtle sound effect should also play to provide auditory feedback of the set completion.
    *   **"Generate Set" Button (Adding Sets):** A button labeled "Generate Set" should be placed below the last set row. When the user taps this button, a new set row should be dynamically added below the existing rows. The "Weight" and "Reps" input fields in the newly generated row should be pre-filled with the same values as the previous set, but the user should be able to edit these values if needed.
    *   **"X" Button (Deleting User-Generated Sets):** An "X" button should be included on each set row. This button allows the user to delete set rows that they have generated using the "Generate Set" button. The initial set rows (those defined as part of the workout plan) should *not* be deletable.
    *   **"Complete Exercise" Button (Marking Exercise Completion):** A button labeled "Complete Exercise" should be placed below the set rows for each exercise. When the user taps this button, the entire exercise table/card should be visually marked as complete by covering it with the same semi-transparent dark blue overlay used for completed sets. A sound effect should also play. Tapping the "Complete Exercise" button again should toggle the completion status, removing the overlay and marking the exercise as incomplete.
    ## UI/UX Design Prompts for Fitness Coaching App (Part 3: RPE Selection, Rest Timer, and Exercise Details Modal - Detailed - Markdown)

**Continuing from Part 2:** This section details the functionality of the RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) selection process, the rest timer, and the modal that appears when the user taps on an exercise name to view the video and description.

**V. RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) Selection Process:**

1.  **Triggering RPE Selection:** When the user taps on the dedicated RPE display box within a set row (as described in Part 2), a modal pop-up should appear, presenting the user with a set of predefined RPE values to choose from.

2.  **RPE Value Presentation (Within the Pop-up):** The RPE values should be presented clearly and concisely within the pop-up, along with their corresponding descriptions. Each RPE value should be tappable, allowing the user to select it. The following RPE values and descriptions should be included:

    *   6 = "You could do 4 or more reps. RPE values under 6 are difficult to estimate accurately."
    *   6.5 = "You could perform 3-4 more reps before reaching failure."
    *   7 = "You could comfortably perform 3 more reps."
    *   7.5 = "You could perform 2-3 more reps before reaching failure."
    *   8 = "You could comfortably perform 2 more reps before failure."
    *   8.5 = "You could perform 1-2 more reps before reaching failure."
    *   9 = "You could comfortably perform 1 more rep before failure."
    *   9.5 = "You could possibly do 1 more rep before reaching failure."
    *   10 = "Maximum exertion. No more reps are possible."

3.  **RPE Value Selection and Pop-up Closure:** When the user taps on an RPE value within the pop-up:

    *   The pop-up should smoothly close or fade out.
    *   The selected RPE value (e.g., "RPE 7") should be displayed within the RPE display box in the set row. The RPE display box should be visually distinct from the weight and reps input fields, perhaps using a different background color or a subtle border.

**VI. Rest Timer Functionality:**

1.  **Triggering the Rest Timer:** The rest timer should be triggered automatically when the user checks the "Done" checkbox for a set row (as described in Part 2).

2.  **Rest Timer Display and Countdown:** When the rest timer is triggered:

    *   A clear and prominent timer display should appear at the bottom of the screen (or within the modal bottom sheet if it is still open).
    *   The timer should begin counting down from 3 minutes (180 seconds). The countdown should be displayed in a clear digital format (e.g., 3:00, 2:59, 2:58...).
    *   The timer display should be visually distinct and easily noticeable.

3.  **Auditory Notification (Timer Completion):** When the timer reaches 0:00, a distinct but not jarring sound effect should play to notify the user that their rest period is over.

4.  **Timer Pausing and Resuming:**

    *   If the app is minimized or the user navigates away from the workout screen while the rest timer is running, the timer should pause.
    *   When the user returns to the workout screen, the timer should resume from the point at which it was paused.

5.  **Rest Timer Customization (User-Created Workouts Only):** In workouts that the user has created themselves (using the "Create Your Workout" feature), they should be able to customize the rest timer duration. This customization option could be presented as:

    *   A time picker UI element (e.g., a spinner or a scrollable list of times) that appears when the user taps on the timer display before starting the countdown.
    *   A setting within the workout creation process that allows the user to set a default rest time for the workout.

**VII. Exercise Details Modal (Video and Description):**

1.  **Triggering the Exercise Details Modal:** When the user taps on the exercise name within an exercise table/card (as described in Part 2), a separate modal or overlay should appear, providing more detailed information about the exercise.

2.  **Modal Content and Structure:** The exercise details modal should contain the following elements:

    *   **Exercise Video (If Available):** If a video demonstration of the exercise is available, it should be displayed prominently at the top of the modal. The video player should include standard controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen). The video should autoplay if the user has this setting enabled, otherwise a play button should be shown.
    *   **Exercise Description (Detailed Explanation):** A detailed written description of the exercise should be displayed below the video (or at the top if no video is available). This description should explain the proper form, technique, and any relevant safety considerations.
    *   **Close Button (Modal Dismissal):** A clear "Close" button (or an "X" icon) should be provided, allowing the user to easily dismiss the modal and return to the workout view.
    ## UI/UX Design Prompts for Fitness Coaching App (Part 4: Workout Completion, Calendar, Editing, and Custom Workouts - Detailed - Markdown)

**Continuing from Part 3:** This section covers the features related to completing workouts, tracking progress through the calendar, editing past workouts, and the functionality for users to create their own custom workouts.

**VIII. Workout Completion Process:**

1.  **Triggering Workout Completion:** When the user taps the "Finish Workout" button located at the bottom of the workout details modal (as described in Part 2), the workout completion process should be initiated.

2.  **Workout Completion Pop-up:** A modal pop-up should appear upon tapping "Finish Workout," displaying the following information:

    *   **Congratulatory Message:** A positive and encouraging message congratulating the user on completing their workout (e.g., "Workout Complete!", "Great job!", "You crushed it!").
    *   **Total Workouts Completed Count:** Display the total number of workouts the user has completed since they started using the app. This provides a sense of accomplishment and progress tracking.
    *   **Social Sharing Options (Optional):** Include buttons or icons that allow the user to share their workout completion on various social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, Twitter). These sharing options should be configurable, allowing the user to choose which platforms they want to share to.
    *   **Close Button:** A clear "Close" button (or an "X" icon) should be provided to dismiss the pop-up and return to the "Workout" tab.

3.  **Workout Data Saving and Tracking:** When the user closes the workout completion pop-up (or if they close the workout details modal at any time during the workout), the following workout data should be automatically saved to the app's database:

    *   Workout Name
    *   Date and Time of Workout
    *   Exercises Performed
    *   Sets, Reps, Weight, and RPE for each set
    *   Completion Status of each exercise (completed or not)
    *   Overall Workout Completion Status (completed or not)

    This saved data will be used for tracking the user's progress, generating progress visualizations (in the "Profile Dashboard"), and displaying past workouts in the calendar view.

**IX. Interactive Calendar View (Progress Tracking):**

1.  **Calendar Display and Navigation:** Below the "My Plan" section (or in a separate "Calendar" tab within the "Workout" section), an interactive calendar view should be displayed. This calendar allows users to visualize their workout schedule and track their progress over time.

    *   **Calendar Views (Yearly, Monthly, Weekly):** The calendar should offer different views: yearly, monthly, and weekly. Users should be able to easily switch between these views using buttons or a dropdown menu.
    *   **Workout Indication on Calendar Days:** Completed workouts should be visually marked on the corresponding calendar days. This could be achieved using colored dots, checkmarks, or other visual cues. Assigned (but not yet completed) workouts should also be visible on the calendar, perhaps using a different visual cue (e.g., a lighter color or an outline).

2.  **Workout Details Pop-up (from Calendar):** When the user taps on a calendar day that contains a completed workout, a modal pop-up should appear, displaying the details of that specific workout:

    *   Workout Name
    *   Date and Time of Workout
    *   Exercises Performed
    *   Sets, Reps, Weight, and RPE for each set
    *   Completion Status of each exercise

3.  **Editing Past Workouts (from Calendar):** The workout details pop-up accessed from the calendar should include an "Edit" button.

    *   **Editing Functionality:** When the user taps the "Edit" button:
        *   The workout details modal (the bottom sheet) should open, pre-populated with the data from the selected past workout.
        *   The user should be able to modify any of the workout data (exercises, sets, reps, weight, RPE).
        *   There should be a clear visual indication that the user is editing a *past* workout (e.g., a different background color in the modal or a label like "Editing Past Workout").
        *   Changes made to the past workout data should be saved to the database, updating the workout history.

**X. Workout Rescheduling (Drag and Drop in Calendar):**

1.  **Drag and Drop Functionality:** Users should be able to reschedule assigned workouts within the calendar by dragging and dropping them from one day to another.

    *   **Drag Visual Feedback:** When the user starts dragging a workout from the calendar, the dragged workout should become semi-transparent, providing visual feedback that it is being moved.
    *   **Drop Target Highlighting:** When the dragged workout is hovered over a valid drop target (another calendar day), that day should be visually highlighted to indicate that it is a valid drop location.
    *   **Data Update on Drop:** When the user drops the workout onto a new day, the workout's scheduled date should be updated in the database, effectively rescheduling the workout.

2.  **"Reset Workout Splits" Button (Returning to Default Schedule):** A "Reset Workout Splits" button should be placed above the calendar view.

    *   **Reset Functionality:** When the user taps this button, all workouts that have been manually moved in the calendar (using drag and drop) should be reset to their original assigned days as determined by the AI coach's training plan generation logic.

**XI. Workout Cancellation (from Calendar):**

1.  **Workout Cancellation Options:** When the user taps on a calendar day that contains an assigned (but not yet completed) workout, a pop-up should appear, presenting the user with two options: "Edit" and "Cancel."

2.  **"Cancel" Functionality:** If the user selects "Cancel," the assigned workout should be removed from that day in the calendar and deleted from the database, effectively canceling the workout.
## UI/UX Design Prompts for Fitness Coaching App (Part 5: Create Your Workout, Nutrition, and Final Details - Detailed - Markdown)

**Continuing from Part 4:** This section covers the "Create Your Workout" feature, the "Nutrition" section, and other final details to complete the UI/UX design specifications.

**XII. "Create Your Workout" Feature (Custom Workout Creation):**

1.  **Accessing "Create Your Workout":** The "Create Workout" button (as described in Part 1) should trigger the display of a modal pop-up dedicated to creating custom workouts.

2.  **"Create Your Workout" Modal Content:** The modal should contain the following elements:

    *   **Workout Name Input Field:** A text input field should be provided at the top of the modal, allowing the user to name their custom workout. A clear placeholder text (e.g., "Workout Name") should be displayed in the input field.
    *   **Exercise Search and Filtering:** A robust system for searching and filtering exercises should be implemented:

        *   **Search Bar:** A prominent search bar should be provided, allowing users to search for exercises by name. Autocomplete functionality should be implemented to suggest matching exercises as the user types, improving search efficiency.
        *   **Filter Button and Filter Options:** A "Filter" button should be placed near the search bar. Tapping this button should expand a section displaying filter options. These filter options should include:
            *   **Exercise Type:** Filters for different exercise types (e.g., "Gym Exercises," "Home Equipment Exercises," "Home No Equipment Exercises").
            *   **Muscle Groups:** Filters for specific muscle groups targeted by the exercises (e.g., "Chest," "Back," "Legs," "Shoulders," "Biceps," "Triceps," "Abs").
            *   **Equipment:** Filters for exercises using specific equipment (e.g., "Dumbbells," "Kettlebells," "Barbell," "Resistance Bands").
        *   **Exercise Display and Selection:** The exercises matching the search and filter criteria should be displayed in a clear and organized list below the search bar and filter options. Each exercise in the list should display:
            *   Exercise Name
            *   Small Image or Icon
            *   Exercise Type (e.g., "Gym," "Home")
            *   Targeted Muscle Groups (textual or icon representation)
            *   Equipment Needed (textual or icon representation)
        *   Tapping on an exercise in the list should select it and add it to the user's custom workout.

    *   **Workout Table (Adding Exercises and Sets):** A table or list should be displayed within the modal, showing the exercises that the user has added to their custom workout. For each exercise, the user should be able to:

        *   **Add Sets:** A "Add Set" button should be provided for each exercise. Tapping this button should add a new set row to the exercise, with input fields for weight, reps, and RPE (similar to the exercise tables in the pre-defined workouts).

    *   **"Create Workout" Button (Saving the Custom Workout):** A button labeled "Create Workout" should be placed at the bottom of the modal. Tapping this button should:

        *   Save the custom workout (including the workout name, exercises, sets, reps, and RPE) to the app's database.
        *   Close the "Create Your Workout" modal.
        *   The newly created workout should then be available to the user in the "Explore Workouts" section and available to be added to their calendar.

**XIII. "Nutrition" Section:**
